      <p><span style="float: left; font-size: 600%; line-height: 80%;vertical-align: middle; padding: 1 8px;">S</span>o you’ve read the headlines — “<a href="https://qz.com/1784161/netflixs-leads-all-2020-oscar-nominations-thanks-to-the-irishman-and-marriage-story/">Netflix has taken over the Oscars</a>,” and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-netflix-leads-all-hollywood-studios-24-nominations-1268945">many</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/number-of-netflix-oscar-nominations-per-year-chart-2020-1">more</a> of the <a href="">like</a>. In a few short years, Netflix went from being a fringe Oscars competitor to leading the field in total nominations.</p>

<p>Last year, the studio received its first Oscar nomination for best picture. This year, in 2020, movies released by Netflix garnered a whopping 24 nominations, almost doubling the total sum of nominations from previous years for the studio. It is undoubtedly a major victory for Netflix amid ongoing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123883/roma-netflix-best-picture-oscar-buzz-release-strategy-alfonso-cuaron">tensions</a> with the Academy and industry professionals.</p>

      <p>In order to be eligible for an Oscar, a film must be screened in theaters for at least seven days in both New York City and Los Angeles. In 2018, Netflix began making exceptions to its strict <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/netflix-grants-theatrical-release-andy-serkis-mowgli-1159414">day-and-date</a> policy. Previously, any films released by the studio in theaters began streaming on the same day — now, however, Netflix occassionally grants exclusive theatrical releases for films and begins streaming the film at a later date. </p>

<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/27/20835697/netflix-fall-movie-lineup-theatrical-release-steven-soderbergh-laundromat-martin-scorsese-irishman">released</a> 10 movies with exclusive theatrical windows ahead of their online release in 2019, several of which went on to be nominated for an Oscar.</p>

<p>For comparison, Netflix gave only four films theatrical releases in 2018: <i>Bird Box, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Mowgli</i>, and the Academy Award-winning <i>Roma</i>. This year’s increase in Oscar nominations, therefore, isn’t necessarily a story of improving quality — it could be a story of Netflix's increasing will to screen original movies and toss their hat in the ring for an Oscar.</p>

    <p>Though Netflix does not publicly disclose box office figures for its films with theatrical releases, film newssite <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/">IndieWire</a> was able to estimate weekend grosses by looking at individual theater's websites.</p>

<p>In terms of revenue earned, Netflix's <i>The Irishman</i> has been the most successful with an estimated domestic gross of $7 million. Still, at its peak, <i>The Irishman</i> only played in 500 theaters (in its fifth week since opening). Critics have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/07/why-netflix-isnt-giving-scorseses-the-irishman-a-wider-release.html">argued</a> that Netflix is foregoing potentially "millions" by not giving the film a wide theatrical release.</p>

<p>Any earnings at the box office was unlikely to offset <i>The Irishman</i>'s reported budget of $159 million, though, under Netflix's current policy. Netflix films rarely stay in theaters for more than two months, with the notable exception of <i>Roma</i> — by its 15th week in theaters, <i>Roma</i> had grossed an estimated $3,975,000.</p>

<p>Most Netflix films went down to minimal theater play and earnings following its online release, with <i>Roma</i>, again, being the exception. In its 10th week of release — the weekend following the Oscar nominations announcement — it made an additional $175,000, earning more than $3 million in sum.</p>

<p>In the lead up to the 2019 Oscars ceremony, Netflix reportedly <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/02/25/netflix-roma-oscar-campaign-green-book/">spent</a> between $40 and $60 million promoting <i>Roma</i>. Despite the company's hesitance to screen original films in theaters and abandon its business model, it clearly wants to build prestige and money is little object in that race — <i>The Irishman</i>'s large budget is further confirmation.</p>

<p><i>The Irishman</i>'s budget was <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2017/02/martin-scorsese-the-irishman-robert-deniro-netflix-paramount-1201785658/">initially</a> estimated to be around $100 million due to the cost of de-aging technology and expensive CGI. Concerns about the cost and effectiveness of this technology caused Paramount Pictures to pull its support for the film in early 2017 — and in swooped Netflix.</p>

<p>Martin Scorsese, the director behind <i>The Irishman</i>, has <a href="https://qz.com/1742603/martin-scorsese-says-theaters-shouldnt-just-be-for-marvel-movies/">advocated</a> for the theatrical experience on numerous occassions. Netflix, wanting to keep Scorsese happy while not backing down on its stance, gave the film a more than a monthlong run and established partnerships with small, independent theater chains.</p> 

<p>Several of the U.S.'s biggest theater chains — including AMC, Regal and Cinemark — have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-01-13/oscar-nominations-2020-amc-regal-theaters-boycott-netflix">refused</a> to play Netflix's movies because it did not agree to an exclusive 90 day release window, as is par for the course in Hollywood.</p>

<p>The result is that landmark films from legendary filmmakers like Scorsese — and even those who are newer to the scene — are blacklisted from wide releases because of theater chains adhering to old business practices, and Netflix's determination to push the ball forward in the spirit of change.</p>
